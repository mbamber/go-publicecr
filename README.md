# go-publicecr

`go-publicecr` is a module for listing ECR image tags on a public ECR repository.

## Why go-publicecr

The official Go SDK does not support interacting with ECR repositories that you do not own. This module allows you to list image tags on any repository, whether you own it or otherwise.

## Issue Tracking

Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mbamber/go-publicecr/issues) to raise any issues. I can't promise I'll be able to support everything as this project is largely driven by my own needs. See [Contributing](#contributing) if you'd like to contibute to a new feature/bug fix.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please raise a PR and include any relevant ticket references.
